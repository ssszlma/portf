Hey there!

Welcome to my blog! I'm glad you're here! I'm not too sure about what I'll be writing here going forward, but I promise it'll be interesting!! (maybe)


My name is Salma, I'm 14, Somali, and a sophomore in highschool and passionate about STEM. You can usually find me building [projects](https://salmaj.me/projects), competing at hackathons, or engaging in Competitive Programming contests online. I'm also a [MITES](https://mites.mit.edu/) scholar and enjoy attending Math Circles like [VPMC](https://promys.org/programs/pathways/details/) and the in-person circle they run at my school! Outside of STEM I also enjoy writing poetry, [debate](https://www.bostondebate.org/), learning new languages, and [linguistics](https://naclo.org/).

On this blog, you can expect to find a variety of topics ranging from the etymology of random words to complex Computer Science concepts. Feel free to explore the rest of my website, connect with me on the platforms listed at the bottom of this page, and reach out to me directly with comments/critique or to work on a project.

Thanks for reading this far!

-- Salma
